PETUNIA,He’s in there. Vernon...      
UNCLE VERNON,I’m warning you if you can’t control that bloody bird it’ll have to go.     
HARRY,But she’s bored!      
HARRY,If I could only let out for an hour or two      
VERNON,Huh huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No sir!    
HARRY,But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends... not one… all summer.      
DUDLEY,Who’d want to be friends with you?      
UNCLE VERNON,I should think you’d be a little more grateful.      
UNCLE VERNON,We’ve raised you since you were a baby given you the food off our table even let you have Dudley’s second bedroom purely out of the goodness of our hearts.   
AUNT PETUNIA,Not now Pupkins. For when the Masons arrive.     
UNCLE VERNON,Which should be any minute!      
UNCLE VERNON,Ahem...Now let’s go over our schedule once again shall we?

DOBBY,Oh oh yes sir! Dobby understands!    
DOBBY,It’s just that Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult sir

HARRY,Your family?

UNCLE VERNON,You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!      
HARRY,Sorry.      
UNCLE VERNON,One more sound and you’ll wish you’d never been born boy!    
UNCLE VERNON,And fix that door!      
HARRY,Yes sir... See why I’ve got to go back?     
HARRY,I don’t belong here.      
HARRY,I belong in your world at Hogwarts.     
HARRY,It’s the only place I’ve got friends!      
DOBBY,Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?      
HARRY,Well I expect they’ve... been- hang on-     
HARRY,how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?      
DOBBY,Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby.      
DOBBY,Heh- Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him Harry Potter might not want to go back to school sir.   
HARRY,Give me those now!     
DOBBY,No! Ahh! Ooh...      
HARRY,Dobby get back here!     
HARRY,Dobby please no!    
DOBBY,Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school!      
HARRY,I can’t. Hogwarts is my home!      
DOBBY,Then Dobby must do it sir for Harry Potter’s own good.

UNCLE VERNON,I’m so sorry! It’s my nephew- he’s very disturbed.

LUCIUS MALFOY,Certain poisons and the like...

LUCIUS MALFOY,Though if his marks dont pick up --      
DRACO, Its not my fault the teachers have favorites.      
DRACO,That Hermione Granger --      
LUCIUS MALFOY,I would have thought youd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam.      
MR. BORGIN,Its the same all over.

LUCIUS MALFOY,Forgive me.      
LUCIUS MALFOY,Your scar is legend.      
LUCIUS MALFOY,As of course is the wizard who gave it to you.    
HARRY,Voldemort killed my parents.      
HARRY,He was nothing more than a murderer.      
LUCIUS MALFOY,You must be very brave to mention his name.      
LUCIUS MALFOY,Or very foolish.      
HERMIONE,Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.      
LUCIUS MALFOY,And you must be Miss Granger.      
LUCIUS MALFOY,Yes Draco has told me all about you.     
LUCIUS MALFOY,And your parents.

LUCIUS MALFOY,Busy time at the Ministry Arthur all those extra raids?    
LUCIUS MALFOY,I do hope theyre paying you overtime but judging by the state of this Id say not.     
LUCIUS MALFOY,Whats the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they dont even pay you well for it?      
MR. WEASLEY,We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard Malfoy.     
LUCIUS MALFOY,Clearly.      
LUCIUS MALFOY,Associating with Muggles.      
LUCIUS MALFOY,And I thought your family could sink no lower.

FILCH,Oh dear we are in trouble.    
SNAPE,You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.      
SNAPE,Do you have any idea how serious this is?      
SNAPE,You have risked the exposure of our world.      
SNAPE,Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow.      
SNAPE,thats been on these grounds since before you were born.

HARRY,Professor Dumbledore.      
HARRY,Professor McGonagall.      
SNAPE,Headmaster these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.      
FILCH,As such...      
DUMBLEDORE,I am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself.      
DUMBLEDORE,However as head of Gryffindor house it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.     
RON,Well go and get our stuff then.     
MCGONAGALL,What are you talking about Mr. Weasley?     
RON,Youre going to expel us arent you?     
MCGONAGALL,Not today Mr. Weasley but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done.     
MCGONAGALL,I will be writing to your families tonight and you will both receive detention.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Morning everyone.     
CLASS,Good morning everyone.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Good morning Professor Sprout.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Welcome to Greenhouse Three Second Years.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Today we will be re-potting Mandrakes.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Now who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Yes Miss Granger.     
HERMIONE,Mandrake or Mandragora is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state.     
HERMIONE,Its also quite dangerous.      
HERMIONE,The Mandrakes cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.      
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.      
PROFESSOR SPROUT,As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries wont kill you yet.      
PROFESSOR SPROUT,But they could knock you out for hours which is why I have given you earmuffs for auditory protection.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,So could you please put them on right away? Quickly.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Flaps tight down and watch me closely.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,You grasp your Mandrake firmly.      
PROFESSOR SPROUT,You pull it sharply up out of the pot.      
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Got it? And now you dunk it down into the other pot      
PROFESSOR SPROUT,and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.      
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Longbottoms been neglecting his earmuffs.      
SEAMUS,No maam hes just fainted.    
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Yes well just leave him there.    
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Right on we go.     
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Plenty of pots to go around.      
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

LOCKHART,Me. Gilderoy Lockhart Order of Merlin Third Class Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weeklys Most-Charming-Smile Award   
LOCKHART,But I dont talk about that.      
LOCKHART,I didnt get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!      
LOCKHART,Now be warned.     
LOCKHART,It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.      
LOCKHART,You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.      
LOCKHART,Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.      
LOCKHART,I must ask you not to scream.      
LOCKHART,It might provoke them.      
SEAMUS,Cornish pixies?      
LOCKHART,Freshly caught Cornish pixies.      
LOCKHART,Laugh if you will Mr. Finnegan but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.     
LOCKHART,Lets see what you make of them.      
LOCKHART,Come on now round them up round them up!    
LOCKHART,Theyre only pixies.      
CORNISH PIXIES,You just stay there!      
NEVILLE,Please get me down!     
HERMIONE,Get off me!      
HARRY,Stop. Hold still!      
LOCKHART,Peskipiksi Pesternomi!      
LOCKHART,Ill ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.      
RON,What do we do now?      
HERMIONE,Immobulus!      
NEVILLE,Why is it always me?      
WOOD,I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.      
WOOD,Were gonna train earlier harder and longer.     
WOOD,What...? I dont believe it.      
WOOD,Where you think youre going Flint?     
FLINT,Quidditch practice.      
WOOD,I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.      
FLINT,Easy Wood. Ive got a note.     
RON,I smell trouble.      
WOOD,I Professor Severus Snape do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today owing to the need to train their new Seeker.   
WOOD,Youve got a new Seeker. Who?      
HARRY,Malfoy?      
DRACO,Thats right.      
DRACO,And thats not all thats new this year.      
RON,Those are Nimbus 2001 s.      
RON,How did you get those?      
FLINT,A gift from Dracos father.      
DRACO,You see Weasley unlike some my father can afford the best.   
HERMIONE,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.      
HERMIONE,They got in on pure talent.      
DRACO,No one asked your opinion you filthy little Mudblood.     
RON,Youll pay for that one Malfoy.     
RON,Eat slugs!      
HERMIONE,You okay Ron?     
HERMIONE,Say something.      
COLIN,Wow! Can you turn him around Harry?     
HARRY,No Colin get out of the way.    
HARRY,Lets take him to Hagrids.      
HARRY,Hell know what to do.      
HAGRID,This calls for a specialists equipment.      
HAGRID,Nothing to do but wait till it stops Im afraid.     
HAGRID,Okay.      
HAGRID,Better out than in.      
HAGRID,Who was Ron trying to curse anyway?     
HARRY,Malfoy. He called Hermione...      
HARRY,Well I dont know exactly what it means.     
HERMIONE,He called me a Mudblood.      
HAGRID,He did not.      
HARRY,Whats a Mudblood?      
HERMIONE,It means dirty blood.      
HERMIONE,Mudbloods a foul name for someone whos Muggle-born.      
HERMIONE,Someone with non-magic parents.      
HERMIONE,Someone like me.      
HERMIONE,Its not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.      
HAGRID,See the thing is Harry there are some wizards like the Malfoy family...who think theyre better than everyone else because theyre pure-blood.  
HARRY,Thats horrible.      
RON,Its disgusting.      
HAGRID,And its codswallop to boot.      
HAGRID,Dirty blood.      
HAGRID,Why there isnt a wizard alive today thats not half-blood or less.     
HAGRID,More to the point theyve yet to think of a spell that our Hermione cant do.     
HAGRID,Come here.      
HAGRID,Dont you think on it Hermione.     
HAGRID,Dont you think on it for one minute.      
LOCKHART,Harry Harry Harry.    
LOCKHART,Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?      
HARRY,Not really.      
LOCKHART,Fame is a fickle friend Harry.     
LOCKHART,Celebrity is as celebrity does.      
LOCKHART,Remember that.      
VOICE,Come.      
VOICE,Come to me.      
HARRY,What?      
LOCKHART,Sorry?      
HARRY,That voice.      
LOCKHART,Voice?      
HARRY,Didnt you hear it?      
LOCKHART,What are you talking about Harry?     
LOCKHART,I think youre getting a bit drowsy.      
LOCKHART,And great Scott no wonder.     
LOCKHART,Look at the time.      
LOCKHART,Weve been here nearly four hours.      
LOCKHART,Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.      
HARRY,Spooky.      
VOICE,Blood.      
VOICE,I smell blood.      
VOICE,Let me rip you.      
VOICE,Let me kill you.      
VOICE,Kill!      
VOICE,Kill!      
VOICE,Kill!      
HERMIONE,Harry!      
HARRY,Did you hear it?      
RON,Hear what?      
HARRY,That voice.      
HERMIONE,Voice? What voice?      
HARRY,I heard it first in Lockharts office.      
HARRY,And then again just...      
VOICE,Its time.      
HARRY,Its moving.      
HARRY,I think its going to kill.      
RON,Kill?      
HERMIONE,Harry wait! Not so fast!     
HARRY,Strange.      
HARRY,Ive never seen spiders act like that.      
RON,I dont like spiders.      
RON,Whats that?      
HERMIONE,The Chamber of Secrets has been opened.          
HERMIONE,Enemies of the Heir beware.     
HERMIONE,Its written in blood.      
HARRY,Oh no.     
HARRY,Its Filchs cat.      
HARRY,Its Mrs. Norris.      
DRACO,Enemies of the Heir beware.     
DRACO,Youll be next Mudbloods.     
FILCH,Whats going on here?      
FILCH,Go on. Make way make way.     
FILCH,Potter?      
FILCH,What are you...?      
FILCH,Mrs. Norris?      
FILCH,Youve murdered my cat.      
HARRY,No. No.      
FILCH,Ill kill you.      
FILCH,Ill kill you!      
DUMBLEDORE,Argus!      
DUMBLEDORE,Argus I...     
DUMBLEDORE,Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.      
DUMBLEDORE,Everyone except you three.      
DUMBLEDORE,Shes not dead Argus.     
DUMBLEDORE,She has been Petrified.      
LOCKHART,Aghh! Thought so.      
LOCKHART,So unlucky I wasnt there.      
LOCKHART,I know exactly the countercurse that couldve spared her.      
DUMBLEDORE,But how she has been Petrified I cannot say.     
FILCH,Ask him.      
FILCH,Its him thats done it.      
FILCH,You saw what he wrote on the wall.      
HARRY,Its not true sir. I swear.     
HARRY,I never touched Mrs. Norris.      
FILCH,Rubbish.      
SNAPE,If I might headmaster?     
SNAPE,Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.      
SNAPE,However the circumstances are suspicious.      
SNAPE,I for one dont recall seeing Potter at dinner.    
LOCKHART,Im afraid thats my doing Severus.     
LOCKHART,You see Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.     
HERMIONE,Thats why Ron and I went looking for him professor.     
HERMIONE,Wed just found him when he said...      
SNAPE,Yes Miss Granger?     
HARRY,When I said I wasnt hungry.      
HARRY,We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.      
DUMBLEDORE,Innocent until proven guilty Severus.     
FILCH,My cat has been Petrified.      
FILCH,I want to see some punishment!      
DUMBLEDORE,We will be able to cure her Argus.     
DUMBLEDORE,As I understand it Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.     
DUMBLEDORE,When matured a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.     
DUMBLEDORE,And in the meantime I strongly recommend caution to all.      
HERMIONE,Its a bit strange isnt it?     
HARRY,Strange?      
HERMIONE,You hear this voice a voice only you can hear...     
HERMIONE,and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. Its just strange.      
HARRY,Do you think I should have told them?      
HARRY,Dumbledore and the others I mean?     
RON,Are you mad?      
HERMIONE,No Harry. Even in the wizarding world hearing voices isnt a good sign.    
PICTURE,Shes right you know.     
MCGONAGALL,Could I have your attention please?     
MCGONAGALL,Right. Now today we will be transforming animals into water goblets.    
MCGONAGALL,Like so.      
MCGONAGALL,One two three. Vera Verto.    
MCGONAGALL,Now its your turn.      
MCGONAGALL,Who would like to go first?      
MCGONAGALL,Ahh Mr. Weasley.     
MCGONAGALL,One two three. Vera Verto.    
RON,Vera Verto!      
MCGONAGALL,That wand needs replacing Mr. Weasley.     
MCGONAGALL,Yes Miss Granger?     
HERMIONE,Professor I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.      
MCGONAGALL,Very well.      
MCGONAGALL,You all know of course that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:     
MCGONAGALL,Godric Gryffindor      
MCGONAGALL,Helga Hufflepuff...      
MCGONAGALL,Rowena Ravenclaw      
MCGONAGALL,Salazar Slytherin.      
MCGONAGALL,Now three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously.     
MCGONAGALL,One did not.      
RON,Three guesses who.      
MCGONAGALL,Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts.      
MCGONAGALL,He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.      
MCGONAGALL,In other words pure-bloods.     
MCGONAGALL,Unable to sway the others he decided to leave the school.     
MCGONAGALL,Now according to legend Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the Chamber of Secrets.     
MCGONAGALL,Though shortly before departing he sealed it until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.    
MCGONAGALL,The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within and by so doing purge the school of all those who in Slytherins view were unworthy to study magic.    
HERMIONE,Muggle-borns.      
MCGONAGALL,Well Naturally the school has been searched many times.    
MCGONAGALL,No such chamber has been found.      
HERMIONE,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?      
MCGONAGALL,The Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.      
MCGONAGALL,It is said to be the home of a monster.      
RON,Do you think its true?      
RON, Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?      
HERMIONE,Yes. Couldnt you tell?      
HERMIONE,McGonagalls worried.      
HERMIONE,All the teachers are.      
HARRY,If there really is a Chamber of Secrets and it has been opened that means...    
HERMIONE,The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts.      
HERMIONE,The question is who is it?     
RON,Lets think.      
RON,Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?      
HERMIONE,If youre talking about Malfoy...      
RON,Of course. You heard him.      
RON,Youll be next Mudbloods.     
HERMIONE,I heard him.      
HERMIONE,But Malfoy the Heir of Slytherin?     
HARRY,Maybe Rons right Hermione.     
HARRY,I mean look at his family.     
HARRY,The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.      
RON,Crabbe and Goyle must know.      
RON,Maybe we could trick them into telling.      
HERMIONE,Even they arent that thick.      
HERMIONE,But there might be another way.      
HERMIONE,Mind you it would be difficult.     
HERMIONE,Not to mention wed be breaking about 50 school rules...      
HERMIONE,and itll be dangerous.      
HERMIONE,Very dangerous.      
HERMIONE,Here it is.      
HERMIONE,The Polyjuice Potion.      
HERMIONE,Properly brewed the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.     
RON,You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff well turn into Crabbe and Goyle?     
HERMIONE,Yes      
RON,Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.      
HERMIONE,Exactly.      
HERMIONE,But its tricky.      
HERMIONE,Ive never seen a more complicated potion.      
HARRY,How long will it take to make?      
HERMIONE,A month.      
HARRY,A month?      
HARRY,But Hermione     
HARRY,if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.      
HERMIONE,I know.      
HERMIONE,But its the only plan weve got.      
LEE JORDAN,Another goal for Slytherin!      
LEE JORDAN,They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.      
SLYTHERINS,Yeah! Yeah!      
DRACO,All right there Scarhead?     
WOOD,Watch yourself Harry!     
HARRY,Wood look out!     
HAGRID,Blimey! Harrys got himself a rogue Bludger.      
HAGRID,Thats been tampered with that has.     
RON,Ill stop it.      
HERMIONE,No! Even with a proper wand its too risky.     
HERMIONE,You could hit Harry.      
DRACO,Training for the ballet Potter!!     
DRACO,Youll never catch me Potter.     
HERMIONE,Lets go.      
LEE JORDAN,Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.      
LEE JORDAN,Gryffindor wins!      
HERMIONE,Finite Incantatem!      
HARRY,Thank you.      
HERMIONE,Are you okay?      
HARRY,No. I think my arm is broken.      
LOCKHART,Not to worry Harry.     
LOCKHART,I will fix that arm of yours straight away.      
HARRY,No Not you.     
LOCKHART,Boy doesnt know what hes saying.      
LOCKHART,This wont hurt a bit.      
LOCKHART,Brackium Emendo!      
LOCKHART,Yes well that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain and very clearly the bones are not broken. 
HAGRID,Broken? Theres no bones left.      
LOCKHART,Much more flexible though.     
MADAM POMFREY,Mr. Malfoy stop making such a fuss.     
MADAM POMFREY,You can go. Out of my way.      
MADAM POMFREY,Should have been brought straight to me.      
MADAM POMFREY,I can mend bones in a heartbeat but growing them back...     
HERMIONE,You will be able to wont you?     
MADAM POMFREY,Ill be able to certainly.     
MADAM POMFREY,But itll be painful.      
MADAM POMFREY,Youre in for a rough night Potter.     
MADAM POMFREY,Regrowing bones is a nasty business.      
MADAM POMFREY,What do you expect?      
MADAM POMFREY,Pumpkin juice?      
VOICE,Kill. Kill.!!      
VOICE,Time to kill..      
DOBBY,Hello.      
HARRY,Dobby?      
DOBBY,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby.      
DOBBY,Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.      
HARRY,It was you.      
HARRY,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.      
DOBBY,Indeed. Yes sir.     
HARRY,You nearly got Ron and me expelled.      
DOBBY,At least you would be away from here.      
DOBBY,Harry Potter must go home.      
DOBBY,Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see...      
HARRY,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?      
DOBBY,Dobby feels most aggrieved sir.     
DOBBY,Dobby had to iron his hands.      
HARRY,You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby or I might strangle you.     
DOBBY,Dobby is used to death threats sir.     
DOBBY,Dobby gets them five times a day at home.      
HARRY,I dont suppose you could tell me why youre trying to kill me?      
DOBBY,Not kill you sir.     
DOBBY,Never kill you.      
DOBBY,Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.      
DOBBY,We house-elves were treated like vermin sir.     
DOBBY,Of course Dobby is still treated like vermin.     
HARRY,Why do you wear that thing Dobby?     
DOBBY,This sir? It is a mark of the house-elfs enslavement.     
DOBBY,Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.      
DOBBY,Listen.      
DOBBY,Listen!      
DOBBY,Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.      
DOBBY,Harry Potter must not stay here...now that history is to repeat itself.      
HARRY,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?      
DOBBY,Oahh! I shouldnt have said that.      
DOBBY,Bad Dobby! Bad!      
HARRY,Stop it!      
HARRY,Stop it Dobby!     
HARRY,Tell me Dobby when did this happen before?      
HARRY,Whos doing it now?      
DOBBY,Dobby cannot say sir.     
DOBBY,Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.      
HARRY,No Dobby. Tell me.     
HARRY,Who is it?      
MADAM POMFREY,Put him here.      
MADAM POMFREY,What happened?      
DUMBLEDORE,Theres been another attack.      
MCGONAGALL,I think hes been Petrified Madam Pomfrey.     
MCGONAGALL,Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.      
MCGONAGALL,What can this mean Albus?     
DUMBLEDORE,It means that our students are in great danger.      
MCGONAGALL,What should I tell the staff?      
DUMBLEDORE,The truth.      
DUMBLEDORE,Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.      
DUMBLEDORE,It is as we feared Minerva     
DUMBLEDORE,The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.      
HERMIONE,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?      
RON,Of course.      
RON,Dont you see?      
RON,Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.      
RON,Now hes taught Draco how to do it.      
HERMIONE,Maybe.      
HERMIONE,Well have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.      
RON,Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight in the middle of the girls lavatory?      
RON,Dont you think well get caught?      
HERMIONE,No. No one ever comes in here.      
RON,Why?      
HERMIONE,Moaning Myrtle.      
RON,Who?      
HERMIONE,Moaning Myrtle.      
RON,Whos Moaning Myrtle?      
MOANING MYRTLE,Im Moaning Myrtle.      
MOANING MYRTLE,I wouldnt expect you to know me.      
MOANING MYRTLE,Who would ever talk about ugly miserable moping Moaning Myrtle? Aaaaaa…     
HERMIONE,Shes a little sensitive.      
LOCKHART,Gather round!      
LOCKHART,Gather round.      
LOCKHART,Can everybody see me?      
LOCKHART,Can you all hear me?      
LOCKHART,Excellent.      
LOCKHART,In light of the dark events of recent weeks Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club to train you all up.      
LOCKHART,In case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions.      
LOCKHART,For full details see my published works.     
LOCKHART,Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape.      
LOCKHART,He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.      
LOCKHART,I dont want any of you youngsters to worry.      
LOCKHART,Youll still have your Potions master when Im through with him. Never fear.      
LOCKHART,One.Two. Three!      
SNAPE,Expelliarmus!      
HERMIONE,Do you think hes all right?      
RON,Who cares?      
LOCKHART,An excellent idea to show them that Professor Snape...     
LOCKHART,but if you dont mind me saying it was obvious what you were about to do.     
LOCKHART,If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy.     
SNAPE,Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells professor.     
LOCKHART,An excellent suggestion Professor Snape..     
LOCKHART,Lets have a volunteer pair.      
LOCKHART,Potter Weasley how about you?    
SNAPE,Weasleys wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.      
SNAPE,Well be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.      
SNAPE,Might I suggest someone from my own house?      
SNAPE,Malfoy perhaps?     
LOCKHART,Good luck Potter.     
HARRY,Thank you sir.     
LOCKHART,Wands at the ready.      
DRACO,Scared Potter?     
HARRY,You wish.      
LOCKHART,On the count of three cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.      
LOCKHART,We dont want any accidents here.      
LOCKHART,One. Two...      
DRACO,Everte Statum!      
HARRY,Rictusempra!      
LOCKHART,I said disarm only.      
DRACO,Serpensortia!      
SNAPE,Dont move Potter.     
SNAPE,Ill get rid of it for you.      
LOCKHART,Allow me Professor Snape.     
LOCKHART,Alarte Ascendare!      
SNAPE,Vipera Evanesca.      
JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY,What are you playing at?      
RON,Youre a Parselmouth?      
RON,Why didnt you tell us?      
HARRY,Im a what?      
HERMIONE,You can talk to snakes.      
HARRY,I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.      
HARRY,Once. But so what?      
HARRY,I bet loads of people here can do it.      
HERMIONE,No they cant.     
HERMIONE,Its not a very common gift Harry.     
HERMIONE,This is bad.      
HARRY,Whats bad? If I hadnt told that snake not to attack Justin...      
RON,Thats what you said to it.      
HARRY,You were there. You heard me.      
RON,I heard you speaking Parseltongue.      
RON,Snake language.      
HARRY,I spoke a different language?      
HARRY,But I didnt realize...      
HARRY,How can I speak a language without knowing I can?      
HERMIONE,I dont know but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.     
HERMIONE,Harry listen to me.     
HERMIONE,Theres a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.      
HERMIONE,Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.      
HERMIONE,He could talk to snakes too.      
RON,Exactly.      
RON,Now the whole schools gonna think youre his great-great-great grandson.      
HARRY,But Im not.      
HARRY,I cant be.      
HERMIONE,He lived a thousand years ago.      
HERMIONE,For all we know you could be.     
HARRY,Ill see you back in the common room.      
VOICE,I want blood.      
VOICE,They all must die.      
VOICE,Kill. Kill. Kill.      
VOICE,Time to kill.      
FILCH,Caught in the act.      
FILCH,Ill have you out this time Potter.     
FILCH,Mark my words.      
HARRY,No. Mr. Filch! You dont understand...      
HARRY,Professor I swear I didnt.      
MCGONAGALL,This is out of my hands Potter.     
MCGONAGALL,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.      
MCGONAGALL,Sherbet Lemon.      
HARRY,Professor Dumbledore?      
SORTING HAT,Bee in your bonnet Potter?     
HARRY,I...I..I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.      
SORTING HAT,Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.      
SORTING HAT,But I stand by what I said last year.      
SORTING HAT,You would have done well in Slytherin.      
HARRY,Youre wrong.      
DUMBLEDORE,Harry?      
HARRY,Professor.      
HARRY,Your bird...There was nothing I could do.      
HARRY,He just caught fire.      
DUMBLEDORE,And about time too.      
DUMBLEDORE,Hes been looking dreadful for days.      
DUMBLEDORE,Pity you had to see him on a burning day.      
DUMBLEDORE,Fawkes is a phoenix Harry.     
DUMBLEDORE,They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...      
DUMBLEDORE,and then they are reborn from the ashes.      
DUMBLEDORE,Fascinating creatures phoenixes.     
DUMBLEDORE,They can carry immensely heavy loads.      
DUMBLEDORE,Their tears have healing powers.      
HAGRID,Professor Dumbledore sir!     
HAGRID,Wait! Listen!      
HAGRID,Professor Dumbledore sir it wasnt Harry.    
HAGRID,Id be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.      
DUMBLEDORE,Hagriiid!! Relax.      
DUMBLEDORE,I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.      
HAGRID,Of course you dont.      
HAGRID,Ohh! Oww! Right. Well Ill...     
HAGRID,Ill just wait outside then.     
DUMBLEDORE,Yes.      
HARRY,You dont think it was me professor?     
DUMBLEDORE,No Harry. I do not think it was you.     
DUMBLEDORE,But I must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?      
HARRY,No sir. Nothing     
DUMBLEDORE,Very well then.     
DUMBLEDORE,Off you go.      
HERMIONE,Everythings set.      
HERMIONE,We just need a bit of who youre changing into.      
HARRY,Crabbe and Goyle.      
HERMIONE,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle cant burst in on us while were interrogating Malfoy.      
RON,How?      
HERMIONE,Ive got it all worked out.      
HERMIONE,I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.      
HERMIONE,Simple but powerful.     
HERMIONE,Now once theyre asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms.     
RON,Whose hair are you ripping out then?     
HERMIONE,Ive already got mine.      
HERMIONE,Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.      
HERMIONE,I got this off her robes.      
HERMIONE,Im going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.      
HERMIONE,Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.      
HARRY,Ron maybe I should do it.     
RON,Yeah. Right.      
HARRY,Wingardium Leviosa.      
CRABBE,Cool. Umm..um.      
RON,How thick could you get?      
HARRY,Come on lets get them.     
HERMIONE,Well have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.      
HERMIONE,Add the hairs.      
RON,Essence of Crabbe.      
HERMIONE,Cheers.      
RON,I think Im gonna be sick.      
HERMIONE,Me too.      
RON,Harry?      
HARRY,Ron.      
RON,Bloody hell!      
HARRY,We still sound like ourselves.      
HARRY,You need to sound more like Crabbe.      
RON,Bloody hell.      
HARRY,Excellent.      
RON,But wheres Hermione?      
HERMIONE,I...I dont think Im going.      
HERMIONE,You go on without me.      
HARRY,Hermione are you okay?     
HERMIONE,Just go. Youre wasting time.      
HARRY,Come on.      
HARRY,I think the Slytherin common rooms this way.      
PERCY,Excuse me.      
RON,What are you doing d...?      
RON,I mean what are you doing down here?     
PERCY,I happen to be a school prefect.      
PERCY,You on the other hand have no business wandering the corridors at night.    
PERCY,What are your names again?      
HARRY,Im...      
DRACO,Crabbe Goyle where have you been?    
DRACO,Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?      
DRACO,Why are you wearing glasses?      
HARRY,Ah- um.. Reading.      
DRACO,Reading?      
DRACO,I didnt know you could read.      
DRACO,And what are you doing down here Weasley?     
PERCY,Mind your attitude Malfoy.     
DRACO,Well sit down.     
DRACO,Youd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods the way they behave.     
DRACO,Theyre an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.      
DRACO,Whats wrong with you Crabbe?     
RON,Stomachache.      
DRACO,Im surprised the Daily Prophet hasnt done a report on all these attacks.      
DRACO,I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.      
DRACO,Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.      
HARRY,Youre wrong!      
DRACO,What?      
DRACO,You think theres someone here whos worse than Dumbledore?      
DRACO,Well? Do you?      
HARRY,Harry Potter?      
DRACO,Good one Goyle.     
DRACO,Youre absolutely right.      
DRACO,Saint Potter.      
DRACO,And people actually think that hes the Heir of Slytherin?      
HARRY,But then you must have some idea whos behind it all.      
DRACO,You know I dont Goyle.     
DRACO,I told you yesterday.      
DRACO,How many times do I have to tell you?      
DRACO,Is this yours?      
DRACO,But my father did say this:      
DRACO,Its been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.      
DRACO,He wouldnt tell me who opened it.      
DRACO,Only that they were expelled.      
DRACO,The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened a Mudblood died.     
DRACO,So its only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.      
DRACO,As for me I hope its Granger.      
DRACO,Whats the matter with you two?      
DRACO,Youre acting very odd.      
HARRY,Its his stomachache.      
HARRY,Calm down.      
RON,Scar!      
HARRY,Hair!      
DRACO,Hey! Where are you going?      
RON,That was close.      
HARRY,Hermione come out.     
HARRY,Weve got loads to tell you.      
HERMIONE,Go away.      
MOANING MYRTLE,Wait till you see. Its awful.      
HARRY,Hermione?      
HARRY,Are you okay?      
HERMIONE,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?      
HERMIONE,It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrodes robes.      
HERMIONE,Look at my face.      
RON,Look at your tail.      
RON,Have you spoken to Hermione?      
HARRY,She should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls.      
HARRY,Whats this?      
RON,Yuck!      
HARRY,Looks like Moaning Myrtles flooded the bathroom.      
MOANING MYRTLE,Ohh-Uhh..Come to throw something else at me?      
HARRY,Why would I throw something at you?      
MOANING MYRTLE,Dont ask me. Here I am minding my own business and someone thinks its funny to throw a book at me.     
RON,But it cant hurt if someone throws something at you.      
RON,I mean itll just go right through you.     
MOANING MYRTLE,SURE! Lets all throw books at Myrtle because she cant feel it.      
MOANING MYRTLE,Ten points if you get it through her stomach!      
MOANING MYRTLE,Fifty points if it goes through her head!      
HARRY,But who threw it at you anyway?     
MOANING MYRTLE,I dont know. I didnt see them.      
MOANING MYRTLE,I was just sitting in the U-bend thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head.     
MOANING MYRTLE,Whoo-oooh-whoooo...      
HARRY,Tom Marvolo Riddle.      
HARRY,My name is Harry Potter.      
DIARY,Hello Harry Potter my name is Tom Riddle.     
HARRY,Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?

HARRY,Can you tell me?      
DIARY,No. But I can show you.      
DIARY,Let me take you back fifty years ago.      
DIARY,13th June..

HARRY,Hello can you hear me?     
DUMBLEDORE,Riddle! Come.      
TOM RIDDLE,Professor Dumbledore.      
HARRY,Dumbledore?      
DUMBLEDORE,It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour Tom.     
TOM RIDDLE,Yes professor. I suppose I...     
TOM RIDDLE,I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.      
DUMBLEDORE,Im afraid they are Tom.     
DUMBLEDORE,They are true.      
TOM RIDDLE,About the school as well?      
TOM RIDDLE,I dont have a home to go to.      
TOM RIDDLE,They wouldnt really close Hogwarts would they professor?    
DUMBLEDORE,I understand Tom but Im afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.    
TOM RIDDLE,Sir if it all stopped if the person responsible was caught...    
DUMBLEDORE,Is there something you wish to tell me?      
TOM RIDDLE,No sir. Nothing.     
DUMBLEDORE,Very well then. Off you go.     
TOM RIDDLE,Good night sir.     
HAGRID,Lets get you out of there.      
TOM RIDDLE,Evening Hagrid.     
TOM RIDDLE,Im going to have to turn you in Hagrid      
TOM RIDDLE,I dont think you meant it to kill anyone...      
HAGRID,You cant. You dont understand.      
TOM RIDDLE,The dead girls parents will be here tomorrow.      
TOM RIDDLE,The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.      
HAGRID,It wasnt him.      
HAGRID,Aragog never killed no one. Never.      
TOM RIDDLE,Monsters dont make good pets Hagrid.     
TOM RIDDLE,Now stand aside.     
HAGRID,No!      
TOM RIDDLE,Stand aside Hagrid.     
HAGRID,No!      
TOM RIDDLE,Cistem Aperio!      
TOM RIDDLE,Arania Exumai!      
HAGRID,Aragog! Aragog!      
TOM RIDDLE,I cant let you go.      
TOM RIDDLE,Theyll have your wand for this Hagrid.     
TOM RIDDLE,Youll be expelled.      
HARRY,Hagrid!      
HARRY,HAAGRIIID!      
HARRY,Wow!      
HARRY,It was Hagrid.      
HARRY,Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.      
HERMIONE,It cant be Hagrid.      
HERMIONE,It just cant be.      
RON,We dont even know this Tom Riddle.      
RON,He sounds like a dirty rotten snitch.     
HARRY,The monster had killed somebody Ron.     
HARRY,What would any of us have done?      
HERMIONE,Look Hagrids our friend.     
HERMIONE,Why dont we just go and ask him about it?      
RON,That would be a cheerful visit.      
RON,Hello Hagrid. Tell us have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?     
HAGRID,Mad and hairy? You wouldnt be talking about me now would you?    
HARRY,No.      
HARRY,Whats that youve got Hagrid?     
HAGRID,Its Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.      
HAGRID,For the Mandrakes you know.     
HAGRID,Now according to Professor Sprout theyve still got a bit of growing to do.    
HAGRID,But once their acnes cleared up well chop them up and stew them. and then well get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified.     
HAGRID,In the meantime though you three had best be looking after yourselves.    
HAGRID,All right?      
HAGRID,Hello Neville.     
NEVILLE,Harry I dont know who did it but youd better come.    
NEVILLE,Come on!      
HERMIONE,It had to be a Gryffindor.      
HERMIONE,Nobody else knows our password.      
HERMIONE,Unless it wasnt a student.      
RON,Whoever it was they must have been looking for something.     
HARRY,And they found it.      
HARRY,Tom Riddles diary is gone.      
WOOD,All right listen up.     
WOOD,We play our game Hufflepuff doesnt stand a chance.     
WOOD,Were stronger quicker and smarter.     
FRED,Not to mention theyre dead scared that Harry will Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.      
WOOD,Well that too.     
WOOD,Professor McGonagall.      
MCGONAGALL,This match has been canceled.      
WOOD,We cant cancel Quidditch.      
MCGONAGALL,Silence Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.     
MCGONAGALL,Potter you and I will find Mr. Weasley.     
MCGONAGALL,Theres something the both of you have to see.      
MCGONAGALL,I warn you.      
MCGONAGALL,This could be a wee bit of a shock.      
RON,Hermione!      
MCGONAGALL,She was found near the library along with this.      
MCGONAGALL,Does it mean anything to either of you?      
HARRY,No.      
MCGONAGALL,Could I have your attention please?     
MCGONAGALL,Because of recent events these new rules will be put into effect immediately:     
MCGONAGALL,All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening.      

MCGONAGALL,All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.
MCGONAGALL,No exceptions.
MCGONAGALL,I should tell you this:
MCGONAGALL,Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed.
HARRY,Weve got to talk to Hagrid  Ron.
HARRY,I cant believe its him but if he did set the monster loose last time hell know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. Thats a start.
RON,But you heard McGonagall.
RON,Were not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
HARRY,I think its time to get my dads old cloak out again.
HAGRID,Whos there?
HAGRID,Hello? Hello?
HARRY,Whats that for?
HAGRID,Nothing. I was expecting... It doesnt matter. Come on in.
HAGRID,I just made a pot of tea.
HARRY,Hagrid  are you okay?
HAGRID,Im fine. Im all right.
HARRY,Did you hear about Hermione?
HAGRID,Oh yeah. I heard about that  all right.
HARRY,Look  we have to ask you something.
HARRY,Do you know whos opened the Chamber of Secrets?
HAGRID,What you had to understand about that is...
HAGRID,Quick  under the cloak.
HAGRID,Dont say a word.
HAGRID,Be quiet  both of you.
HAGRID,Professor Dumbledore  sir.
DUMBLEDORE,Good evening  Hagrid.
DUMBLEDORE,I wonder  could we...?
HAGRID,Of course. Come in. Come in.
RON,Thats Dads boss.
RON,Cornelius Fudge  Minister of Magic.
FUDGE,Bad business  Hagrid  very bad business.
FUDGE,Had to come.
FUDGE,Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
FUDGE,Things have gone far enough.
FUDGE,The Ministrys got to act.
HAGRID,But I never...
HAGRID,You know I never  professor.
DUMBLEDORE,I want it understood  Cornelius that Hagrid has my full confidence.
FUDGE,Albus  look  Hagrids record is against him.
FUDGE,Ive got to take him.
HAGRID,Take me? Take me where?
HAGRID,Not Azkaban prison.
FUDGE,Im afraid we have no choice  Hagrid.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Already here  Fudge?
LUCIUS MALFOY,Good.
HAGRID,What are you doing here?
HAGRID,Get out of my house!
LUCIUS MALFOY,Believe me I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your...
LUCIUS MALFOY,You call this a house?
LUCIUS MALFOY,No.
LUCIUS MALFOY,I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.
DUMBLEDORE,Well  what exactly is it that you want with me?
LUCIUS MALFOY,The other governors and I have decided its time for you to step aside.
LUCIUS MALFOY,This is an order of suspension.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Youll find all 12 signatures on it.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Im afraid we feel youve rather lost your touch.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Well  what  with all these attacks therell be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.
LUCIUS MALFOY,I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
HAGRID,You cant take Professor Dumbledore away.
HAGRID,Take him away and the Muggle-borns wont stand a chance.
HAGRID,You mark my words  therell be killings next!
LUCIUS MALFOY,You think so?
DUMBLEDORE,Calm yourself  Hagrid.
DUMBLEDORE,If the governors desire my removal I will  of course  step aside.
DUMBLEDORE,However you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Admirable sentiments.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Shall we?
LUCIUS MALFOY,Fudge.
FUDGE,Come  Hagrid.
HAGRID,Well? If...
HAGRID,If anybody was looking for some stuff then all theyd have to do would be to follow the spiders.
HAGRID,Yep. That would lead them right.
HAGRID,Thats all I have to say.
HAGRID,And someone will need to feed Fang while Im away.
FUDGE,Good boy.
RON,Hagrids right.
RON,With Dumbledore gone  therell be an attack a day.
HARRY,Look.
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,Come on  Fang.
HARRY,Come on.
RON,What?
HARRY,You heard what Hagrid said.
HARRY,Follow the spiders.
RON,Theyre heading to the Dark Forest.
RON,Why spiders? Why couldnt it be follow the butterflies?      
RON,Harry I dont like this.     
RON,Harry I dont like this at all.     
HARRY,Shush!      
RON,Can we go back now?      
HARRY,Come on.      
ARAGOG,Who is it?      
HARRY,Dont panic.      
ARAGOG,Hagrid?      
ARAGOG,Is that you?      
HARRY,Were friends of Hagrids.      
HARRY,And you?      
HARRY,Youre Aragog arent you?     
ARAGOG,Yes.      
ARAGOG,Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.      
HARRY,Hes in trouble. Up at the school there have been attacks.     
HARRY,They think its Hagrid.      
HARRY,They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.      
ARAGOG,Thats a lie.      
ARAGOG,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.      
HARRY,Then youre not the monster?      
ARAGOG,No.      
ARAGOG,The monster was born in the castle.      
ARAGOG,I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.      
RON,Harry.      
HARRY,But if youre not the monster then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?     
ARAGOG,We do not speak of it.      
ARAGOG,It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.      
HARRY,But have you seen it?      
ARAGOG,I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me.      
ARAGOG,The girl was discovered in a bathroom.      
ARAGOG,When I was accused Hagrid brought me here.     
RON,Harry!      
HARRY,What?      
HARRY,Well thank you.     
HARRY,Well just go.      
ARAGOG,Go?      
ARAGOG,I think not.      
ARAGOG,My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.      
ARAGOG,But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst.      
ARAGOG,Goodbye friend of Hagrid.     
RON,Can we panic now?      
RON,Know any spells?      
HARRY,One but its not powerful enough for all of them.     
RON,Wheres Hermione when you need her?      
HARRY,Lets go!      
HARRY,Arania Exumai!      
HARRY,Go!      
RON,Glad were out of there.      
HARRY,Arania Exumai!      
RON,Thanks for that.      
HARRY,Dont mention it.      
HARRY,Get us out of here.      
HARRY,Now!      
HARRY,Come on!      
HARRY,Come on move faster!     
HARRY,Come on! Go!      
HARRY,Get us in the air.      
RON,The flying gears jammed!      
HARRY,Come on! Pull!      
RON,Im trying!      
RON,Follow the spiders!      
RON,Follow the spiders.      
RON,If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban Ill kill him.     
RON,I mean what was the point of sending us in there?     
RON,What have we found out?      
HARRY,We know one thing.      
HARRY,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.      
HARRY,He was innocent.      
HARRY,Wish you were here Hermione.     
HARRY,We need you.      
HARRY,Now more than ever.      
RON,Whats that?      
HARRY,Ron...      
HARRY,This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.      
HARRY,Come on.      
HARRY,Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk.      

HARRY,Capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpents eye.
HARRY,Spiders flee before it.
HARRY,Ron  this is it.
HARRY,The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
HARRY,Thats why I can hear it speak.
HARRY,Its a snake.
RON,But if it kills by looking people in the eye  why is it no ones dead?
HARRY,Because no one did look it in the eye.
HARRY,Not directly  at least.
HARRY,Colin saw it through his camera.
HARRY,Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
HARRY,Nick got the full blast of it.
HARRY,But hes a ghost  he couldnt die again.
HARRY,And Hermione had the mirror.
HARRY,I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
RON,And Mrs. Norris?
RON,Im pretty sure she didnt havea camera or a mirror  Harry.
HARRY,The water.
HARRY,There was water on the floor that night.
HARRY,She only saw the basilisks reflection.
HARRY,Spiders flee before it.
HARRY,It all fits.
RON,Hows a basilisk been getting around?
RON,A dirty  great snake.
RON,Someone would have seen it.
HARRY,Hermiones answered that too.
RON,Pipes? Its using the plumbing.
HARRY,Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
HARRY,She died in a bathroom?
HARRY,What if she never left?
RON,Moaning Myrtle.
MCGONAGALL,All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.
MCGONAGALL,All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.
MCGONAGALL,As you can see  the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.
MCGONAGALL,Our worst fear has been realized.
MCGONAGALL,A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.
MCGONAGALL,The students must be sent home.
MCGONAGALL,Im afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
LOCKHART,So sorry. Dozed off.
LOCKHART,What have I missed?
SNAPE,A girl has been snatched by the monster  Lockhart. 
SNAPE,Your moment has come at last.
LOCKHART,My moment?
SNAPE,Werent you saying just last night that youve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
MCGONAGALL,Thats settled. 
MCGONAGALL,Well leave you to deal with the monster  Gilderoy.
MCGONAGALL,Your skills  after all  are legend.
LOCKHART,Very well.
LOCKHART,Ill just be in my office getting...
LOCKHART,Getting ready.
MADAM POMFREY,Who is it that the monsters taken  Minerva?
MCGONAGALL,Ginny Weasley.
RON,Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.
RON,Ginny.
HARRY,Lockhart may be useless  but hes going to try and get into the Chamber.
HARRY,At least we can tell him what we know.
HARRY,Professor  we have some information for you.
HARRY,Are you going somewhere?
LOCKHART,Well  yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
LOCKHART,Got to go.
RON,What about my sister?
LOCKHART,Well… Aemm…
LOCKHART,As to that  most unfortunate.
LOCKHART,No one regrets more than I.
RON,Youre the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. 
RON,You cant go now.
LOCKHART,I must say  when I took the job  there was nothing in the description...
HARRY,Youre running away?
HARRY,After all you did in your books?
LOCKHART,Books can be misleading.
HARRY,You wrote them.
LOCKHART,My dear boy  use your common sense.
LOCKHART,My books wouldnt have sold as well if people didnt think Id done those things.
HARRY,Youre a fraud.
HARRY,Youve been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
RON,Is there anything you can do?
LOCKHART,Yes  now you mention it.
LOCKHART,Im rather gifted with Memory Charms.
LOCKHART,Otherwise  all those wizards would have gone blabbing.
LOCKHART,Id never have sold another book.
LOCKHART,In fact  Im going to have to do the same to you.
HARRY,Dont even think about it.
MOANING MYRTLE,Whos there?
MOANING MYRTLE,Hello  Harry.
MOANING MYRTLE,What do you want?
HARRY,To ask you how you died.
MOANING MYRTLE,It was dreadful.
MOANING MYRTLE,It happened right here in this very cubicle.
MOANING MYRTLE,Id hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.
MOANING MYRTLE,I was crying  and then I heard somebody come in.
HARRY,Who was it  Myrtle?
MOANING MYRTLE,I dont know. I was distraught!
MOANING MYRTLE,But they said something funny  a kind of made-up language.
MOANING MYRTLE,And I realized it was a boy  so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and I died.
HARRY,Just like that? How?
MOANING MYRTLE,I just remember seeing a pair of great  big  yellow eyes over there by that sink.
HARRY,This is it.
HARRY,This is it  Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
RON,Say something. 
RON,Harry say something in Parseltongue!
LOCKHART,Excellent  Harry. Good work.
LOCKHART,Well  then  Ill just be...
LOCKHART,Theres no need for me to stay.
HARRY,Yes  there is.
HARRY,You first.
LOCKHART,Now  boys  what good will it do?
RON,Better you than us.
LOCKHART,But... Obviously  yes.
LOCKHART,Sure you dont want to test it first?
LOCKHART,Its really quite filthy down here.
HARRY,All right. Lets go.
MOANING MYRTLE,Oh  Harry?
MOANING MYRTLE,If you die down there  youre welcome to share my toilet.
HARRY,Thanks  Myrtle.
HARRY,Now  remember: Any sign of movement  close your eyes straightaway.
RON,Go on.
HARRY,This way.
RON,Whats this?
LOCKHART,It looks like a snake.
HARRY,Its a snake skin.
RON,Bloody hell.
RON,Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more.
RON,Heart of a lion  this one.
LOCKHART,The adventure ends here  boys.
LOCKHART,But dont fret.
LOCKHART,The world will know our story.
LOCKHART,How I was too late to save the girl.
LOCKHART,How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body.
LOCKHART,So...You first  Mr. Potter.
LOCKHART,Say goodbye to your memories.
LOCKHART,Obliviate!
RON,Harry! Harry
HARRY,Ron! Ron  are you okay?
RON,Im fine.
LOCKHART,Hello. Who are you?
RON,Ron Weasley.
LOCKHART,Really?
LOCKHART,And who am I?
RON,Lockharts Memory Charm backfired.
RON,He hasnt got a clue who he is.
LOCKHART,Its an odd sort of place  isnt it?
LOCKHART,Do you live here?
RON,No.
LOCKHART,Really?
RON,What do I do now?
HARRY,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
HARRY,Ill go on and find Ginny.
RON,Okay.
HARRY,Ginny! Ginny  please dont be dead.
HARRY,Wake up  wake up.
HARRY,Please wake up.
TOM RIDDLE,She wont wake.
HARRY,Tom. Tom Riddle.
HARRY,What do you mean  she wont wake?
HARRY,Shes not...?
TOM RIDDLE,Shes still alive  but only just.
HARRY,Are you a ghost?
TOM RIDDLE,A memory preserved in a diary for 50 years.
HARRY,Shes cold as ice.
HARRY,Ginny  please dont be dead. Wake up.
HARRY,Youve got to help me  Tom.
HARRY,Theres a basilisk.
TOM RIDDLE,It wont come until its called.
HARRY,Give me my wand  Tom.
TOM RIDDLE,You wont be needing it.
HARRY,Weve got to go. Weve got to save her.
TOM RIDDLE,Im afraid I cant do that.
TOM RIDDLE,You see  as poor Ginny grows weaker  I grow stronger.
TOM RIDDLE,Yes  Harry  it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY,No. She couldnt. She wouldnt.
TOM RIDDLE,It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filchs cat Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
HARRY,But why?
TOM RIDDLE,Because I told her to.
TOM RIDDLE,Youll find I can be very persuasive.
TOM RIDDLE,Not that she knew what she was doing.
TOM RIDDLE,She was  shall we say  in a kind of trance.
TOM RIDDLE,Still  the power of the diary began to scare her.
TOM RIDDLE,She tried to dispose of it in the girls bathroom.
TOM RIDDLE,And then who should find it but you?
TOM RIDDLE,The very person I was most anxious to meet.
HARRY,And why did you want to meet me?
TOM RIDDLE,I knew I had to talk to you  meet you if I could.
TOM RIDDLE,So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.
HARRY,Hagrids my friend.
HARRY,And you framed him  didnt you?
TOM RIDDLE,It was my word against Hagrids.
TOM RIDDLE,Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
HARRY,Ill bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
TOM RIDDLE,He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.
TOM RIDDLE, I knew it wouldnt be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages so that one day
TOM RIDDLE,I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherins noble work.
HARRY,Well  you havent finished it this time.
HARRY,In a few hours  the Mandrake Draught will be ready.
HARRY,And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
TOM RIDDLE,Havent I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesnt matter to me anymore.
TOM RIDDLE,For many months now  my new target has been you.
TOM RIDDLE,How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
TOM RIDDLE,How did you escape with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemorts powers were destroyed?
HARRY,Why do you care how I escaped?
HARRY,Voldemort was after your time.
TOM RIDDLE,Voldemort is my past  present and future.
HARRY,You. Youre the Heir of Slytherin.
HARRY,Youre Voldemort.
TOM RIDDLE,Surely you didnt think .I was going to keep my filthy Muggle fathers name?
TOM RIDDLE,No. I fashioned myself a new name  a name I knew wizards everywhere would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
HARRY,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
TOM RIDDLE,Dumbledores been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
HARRY,Hell never be gone. 
HARRY,Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.
HARRY,Fawkes?
TOM RIDDLE,So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.
TOM RIDDLE,A songbird and an old hat.
TOM RIDDLE,Lets match the power of Lord Voldemort  Heir of Salazar Slytherin against the famous Harry Potter.
TOM RIDDLE,Parseltongue wont save you now  Potter. 
TOM RIDDLE,It only obeys me.
TOM RIDDLE,No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk  but it can still hear you.
TOM RIDDLE,Yes  Potter.
TOM RIDDLE,The process is nearly complete.
TOM RIDDLE,In a few minutes  Ginny Weasley will be dead  and I will cease to be a memory.
TOM RIDDLE,Lord Voldemort will return .very much alive.
HARRY,Ginny?
TOM RIDDLE,Remarkable  isnt it? how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?
TOM RIDDLE,Id guess you have little more than a minute to live.
TOM RIDDLE,Youll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon  Harry.
TOM RIDDLE,Funny  the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl.
TOM RIDDLE,What are you doing?
TOM RIDDLE,Stop. No!
HARRY,Ginny?
GINNY,Harry  It was me.
GINNY,But I swear  I didnt mean to.
GINNY,Riddle made me  and...
GINNY,Harry  youre hurt.
HARRY,Dont worry.
HARRY,Ginny  you need to get yourself out.
HARRY,Follow the Chamber and youll find Ron.
HARRY,You were brilliant  Fawkes.
HARRY,I just wasnt quick enough.
HARRY,Of course.
HARRY,Phoenix tears have healing powers.
HARRY,Thanks.
HARRY,Its all right  Ginny.
HARRY,Its over.
HARRY,Its just a memory.
LOCKHART,Amazing!
LOCKHART,This is just like magic!
DUMBLEDORE,You both realize  of course that in the past few hours  you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules.
HARRY,Yes  sir.
DUMBLEDORE,There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
HARRY,Yes  sir.
DUMBLEDORE,Therefore  it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.
RON,Thanks  sir.
DUMBLEDORE,Now  Mr. Weasley  if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.
DUMBLEDORE,I believe we want our gamekeeper back.
DUMBLEDORE,Harry  First  I want to thank you  Harry.
DUMBLEDORE,You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
DUMBLEDORE,Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
DUMBLEDORE,And second I sense that something is troubling you.
DUMBLEDORE,Am I right  Harry?
HARRY,Its just...
HARRY,You see  sir  I couldnt help but notice certain things  certain...
HARRY,Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
DUMBLEDORE,I see.
DUMBLEDORE,Well  you can speak Parseltongue  Harry. Why?
DUMBLEDORE,Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.
DUMBLEDORE,If Im not mistaken  Harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
HARRY,Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
DUMBLEDORE,Not intentionally but yes.
HARRY,So the Sorting Hat was right.
HARRY,I should be in Slytherin.
DUMBLEDORE,Its true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
DUMBLEDORE,Determination  resourcefulness and if I may say so  a certain disregard for the rules.
DUMBLEDORE,Why  then  did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
HARRY,Because I asked it to.
DUMBLEDORE,Exactly  Harry. Exactly.
DUMBLEDORE,Which makes you different from Voldemort.
DUMBLEDORE,It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
DUMBLEDORE,It is our choices.
DUMBLEDORE,If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor then I suggest you look more closely at this.
DUMBLEDORE,Be careful.
HARRY,Godric Gryffindor.
DUMBLEDORE,It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
HARRY,Dobby.
HARRY,So this is your master.
HARRY,The family you serve is the Malfoys.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Ill deal with you later.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Out of my way  Potter.
LUCIUS MALFOY,So its true. You have returned.
DUMBLEDORE,When the governors learned that Arthur Weasleys daughter was taken into the Chamber  they saw fit to summon me back.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Ridiculous.
DUMBLEDORE,Curiously  Lucius  several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.
LUCIUS MALFOY,How dare you!
DUMBLEDORE,Beg your pardon?
LUCIUS MALFOY,My sole concern has always been and will always be the welfare of this school and  of course  its students.
LUCIUS MALFOY,The culprit has been identified  I presume?
DUMBLEDORE,Yes.
LUCIUS MALFOY,And?
LUCIUS MALFOY,Who was it?
DUMBLEDORE,Voldemort.
DUMBLEDORE,Only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.
LUCIUS MALFOY,I see.
DUMBLEDORE,Fortunately  our young Mr. Potter discovered it.
DUMBLEDORE,One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemorts old school-things should find their way into innocent hands.
DUMBLEDORE,The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Well  let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
HARRY,Dont worry. I will be.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Dumbledore.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Come  Dobby. Were leaving.
HARRY,Sir? I wonder if I could have that?
HARRY,Mr. Malfoy.
HARRY,Mr. Malfoy!
HARRY,I have something of yours.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Mine? I dont know what youre talking about.
HARRY,I think you do  sir.
HARRY,I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasleys cauldron that day at Diagon Alley.
LUCIUS MALFOY,You do  do you?
LUCIUS MALFOY,Why dont you prove it?
LUCIUS MALFOY,Come  Dobby.
HARRY,Open it.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Dobby.
DOBBY,Master has given Dobby a sock.
LUCIUS MALFOY,What? I didnt give...
DOBBY,Master has presented Dobby with clothes.
DOBBY,Dobby is free.
LUCIUS MALFOY,You lost me my servant!
DOBBY,You shall not harm Harry Potter.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Your parents were meddlesome fools too.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Mark my words  Potter.
LUCIUS MALFOY,One day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end.
DOBBY,Harry Potter freed Dobby.
DOBBY,How can Dobby ever repay him?
HARRY,Just promise me something.
DOBBY,Anything  sir.
HARRY,Never try to save my life again.
RON,Welcome back  Sir Nicholas.
SIR NICHOLAS,Thank you.
RON,Good evening  Sir Nicholas.
SIR NICHOLAS,Good evening.
RON,Good to see you  Sir Nicholas.
SIR NICHOLAS,Thank you.
SIR NICHOLAS,Hello.
SIR NICHOLAS,Hermione! Welcome back.
HERMIONE,Thanks  Sir Nicholas.
NEVILLE,Harry. Its Hermione.
RON,Welcome back  Hermione.
HERMIONE,Its good to be back.
HERMIONE,Congratulations.
HERMIONE,I cant believe you solved it.
HARRY,We had loads of help from you.
HARRY,We couldnt have done it without you.
HERMIONE,Thanks.
MCGONAGALL,Could I have your attention  please?
DUMBLEDORE,Before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout  Madam Pomfrey whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified.
DUMBLEDORE,Also  in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled.
HERMIONE,Oh  no.
HAGRID,Sorry Im late.
HAGRID,The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.
HAGRID,Some ruddy bird called Errol.
HAGRID,And Id just like to say that if it hadnt been for you  Harry and Ron and Hermione  of course I would still be you-know-where so Id just like to say thanks.
HARRY,Theres no Hogwarts without you  Hagrid.
