FUDGE,As Minister for Magicit is my duty to inform youMr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffieldcircling a chimney stack.

FUDGE,Pea soup?
HARRY,Nothank you. Minister?
FUDGE,Yes?
HARRY,I don't understand.
FUDGE,Understand?
HARRY,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
FUDGE,Come now Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
FUDGE,On the other handrunning away like thatgiven the state of things was veryvery irresponsible.
HARRY,The state of thingssir?
FUDGE,We have a killer on the loose.
HARRY,Sirius Blackyou mean?
HARRY,But what's he got to do with me?
FUDGE,Nothingof course. You're safe.

HERMIONE,It's in his nature.
RON,A cat? Is that what they told you?
RON,Looks like a pig with hair.
HERMIONE,That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
HERMIONE,Crookshanksjust ignore the mean little boy.
RON,Harry.
HERMIONE,Harry.

HERMIONE,Good morningMr. Weasley.
MR. WEASLEY,Looking forward to a new term?
HARRY,Yeah. It should be great.
MR. WEASLEY,Harrysome within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
MR. WEASLEY,But I think that you need to know the facts.
MR. WEASLEY,You are in danger.
MR. WEASLEY,Grave danger.
HARRY,Has this anything to do with Sirius Blacksir?
MR. WEASLEY,What do you know about Sirius BlackHarry?
HARRY,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
MR. WEASLEY,Do you know why?
MR. WEASLEY,Thirteen years agowhen you stopped...
HARRY,Voldemort.
MR. WEASLEY,Don't say his name.
HARRY,Sorry.
MR. WEASLEY,When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
MR. WEASLEY,But to this dayhe still remains a faithful servant.
MR. WEASLEY,And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
MR. WEASLEY,And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
MR. WEASLEY,To find you.
HARRY,And kill me.
MR. WEASLEY,Harryswear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black.
HARRY,Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
MRS. WEASLEY,Quick. Quick.
MRS. WEASLEY,RonRon!

MRS. WEASLEY,Don't lose him!
HARRY,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...I lost control.

HERMIONE,HonestlyRonit's not funny.
HERMIONE,Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
HARRY,I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
RON,I still think it was brilliant.
HERMIONE,Come on. Everywhere else is full
RON,Who do you think that is?
HERMIONE,Professor R.J. Lupin.
RON,Do you know everything?
RON,How is it she knows everything?
HERMIONE,It's on his suitcaseRonald.
RON,Oh.
HARRY,Do you think he's really asleep?
HERMIONE,Seems to be. Why?
HARRY,I gotta tell you something.
RON,Let me get this straight.
RON,Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
HARRY,Yeah.
HERMIONE,But they'll catch Blackwon't they?
HERMIONE,I meaneveryone's looking for him.
RON,Sure.
RON,Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderousraving lunatic.
HARRY,ThanksRon.
HERMIONE,Why are we stopping?
HERMIONE,We can't be there yet.
RON,What's going on?
HARRY,I don't know.
HARRY,Maybe we've broken down.
HERMIONE,OuchRon. That was my foot.
RON,There's something moving out there.
RON,I think someone's coming aboard.
RON,Bloody hell! What's happening?
HERMIONE,Harry.
HERMIONE,Harryare you all right?
HARRY,Thank you.
LUPIN,Hereeat this. It'll help.
LUPIN,It's all right. It's chocolate.
HARRY,What was that thing that came?
LUPIN,It was a dementor.
LUPIN,One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.
LUPIN,It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
LUPIN,If you'll excuse meI need to have a little word with the driver.
LUPIN,Eat. You'll feel better.
HARRY,What happened to me?
RON,Wellyou sort of went rigid.
RON,We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
HARRY,And did either of you two you know pass out?
RON,No.
RON,I felt weirdthough.
RON,Like I'd never be cheerful again.
HARRY,But someone was screaming.
HARRY,A woman.
HERMIONE,No one was screamingHarry.
DUMBLEDORE,Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
DUMBLEDORE,NowI'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
DUMBLEDORE,FirstI'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
DUMBLEDORE,Good luckprofessor.
HERMIONE,Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolateHarry.
DRACO,Potter. Is it true you fainted?
DRACO,I meanyou actually fainted?
RON,Shove offMalfoy.
HARRY,How did he find out?
HERMIONE,Just forget it.
DUMBLEDORE,Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
DUMBLEDORE,FortunatelyI'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
DUMBLEDORE,Finallyon a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic
DUMBLEDORE,Hogwarts willuntil further noticeplay host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
DUMBLEDORE,The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
DUMBLEDORE,Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
DUMBLEDORE,Dementors are vicious creatures.
DUMBLEDORE,They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
DUMBLEDORE,ThereforeI must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.
DUMBLEDORE,It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
DUMBLEDORE,But you knowhappiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.

HERMIONE,OhhonestlyRon. If you ask meDivination's a woolly discipline.

RON,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
HERMIONE,A fair few.

HARRY,Forget about itguys. See you later.
HARRY,Professorcan I ask you something?
LUPIN,You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggartyes?
LUPIN,I thought it'd be obvious.
LUPIN,I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
HARRY,I did think of Voldemort at first.
HARRY,But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
LUPIN,I'm very impressed.
LUPIN,That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
LUPIN,This is very wise.
HARRY,Before I fainted I heard something.
HARRY,A woman screaming.
LUPIN,Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
LUPIN,Our pain becomes their power.
HARRY,I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
LUPIN,The very first time I saw youHarryI recognized you immediately.
LUPIN,Not by your scarby your eyes.
LUPIN,They're your motherLily's.
LUPIN,Yes. Ohyes. I knew her.
LUPIN,Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
LUPIN,Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
LUPIN,She had a way of seeing the beauty in others evenand most especiallywhen that person could not see it in themselves.
LUPIN,And your fatherJameson the other hand he...
LUPIN,He had a certainshall we saytalent for trouble.
LUPIN,A talentrumor has ithe passed on to you.
LUPIN,You're more like them than you knowHarry.
LUPIN,In timeyou'll come to see just how much.
RON,Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliantbut nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
RON,We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
RON,You heard it's the most...
HARRY,Haunted building in Britain. I know.
HARRY,What's going on?
RON,Probably Neville forgot the password again.
NEVILLE,Hey.
RON,Ohyou're there.
PERCY,Let me throughplease.
PERCY,Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
PERCY,Get backall of you.
PERCY,No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
GINNY,The Fat Lady! She's gone!
RON,Serves her right.
RON,She was a terrible singer.
HERMIONE,It's not funnyRon.
PERCY,Keep calmeveryone. Break into fours.
PERCY,Back to your common room.
PERCY,Be quiet. Make way.
PERCY,The headmaster's here.
FILCH,Come onmove.
PERCY,You heard. Move!
DUMBLEDORE,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
DUMBLEDORE,Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
FILCH,There's no need for ghostsprofessor.
FILCH,The Fat Lady's there.
PERCY,Mind where you're going! Slow down!
PERCY,You listen! I'm Head Boy!
PERCY,Come back here!
DUMBLEDORE,Keep moving!
DUMBLEDORE,Dear ladywho did this to you?
FAT LADY,Eyes like the devilhe's gotand a soul as dark as his name.
FAT LADY,It's himheadmaster.
FAT LADY,The one they all talk about.
FAT LADY,He's heresomewhere in the castle!
FAT LADY,Sirius Black!
DUMBLEDORE,Secure the castleMr. Filch.
DUMBLEDORE,The rest of youto the Great Hall.
FILCH,I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery.
FILCH,There's nothing there.
DUMBLEDORE,Thank you.
TEACHER,The third floor's clear toosir.
DUMBLEDORE,Very good.
SNAPE,I've done the dungeons.
SNAPE,No sign of Blacknor anywhere else in the castle.
DUMBLEDORE,I didn't really expect him to linger.
SNAPE,Remarkable featdon't you think?
SNAPE,To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own completely undetected?
DUMBLEDORE,Quite remarkableyes.
SNAPE,Any theories on how he managed it?
DUMBLEDORE,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
SNAPE,You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
DUMBLEDORE,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
DUMBLEDORE,I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
SNAPE,What about Potter?
SNAPE,Should he be warned?
DUMBLEDORE,Perhaps. But for nowlet him sleep.
DUMBLEDORE,For in dreamswe enter a world that's entirely our own.
DUMBLEDORE,Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
SNAPE,Turn to page 394.
HARRY,Excuse mesir.
HARRY,Where's Professor Lupin?
SNAPE,That's not really your concernis itPotter?
SNAPE,Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
SNAPE,Turn to page 394.
RON,Werewolves?
HERMIONE,Sirwe just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
HERMIONE,We're not meant to start that for weeks.
SNAPE,Quiet.
RON,When did she come in?
RON,Did you see her come in?
SNAPE,Nowwhich one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
SNAPE,No one?
SNAPE,How disappointing.
HERMIONE,Pleasesir.
HERMIONE,An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
HERMIONE,A werewolf has no choice.
HERMIONE,With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
HERMIONE,He'd kill his best friend.
HERMIONE,FurthermoreThe werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
SNAPE,Thank youMr. Malfoy.
SNAPE,That's the second time you've spoken out of turnMiss Granger.
SNAPE,Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
RON,He's got a pointyou know.
SNAPE,Five points from Gryffindor.
SNAPE,As an antidote to your ignoranceand on my deskby Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolfwith emphasis on recognizing it.
HARRY,It's Quidditch tomorrow.
SNAPE,Then I suggest you take extra careMr. Potter.
SNAPE,Loss of limb will not excuse you.
SNAPE,Page 394.
SNAPE,The term werewolf is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were which means man and wolf. Werewolfman-wolf.
SNAPE,There are several ways to become a werewolf.
SNAPE,They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
RON,Go Go Gryffindor!!
HERMIONE,GoHarry! GoHarry!
DUMBLEDORE,Aresto momentum!
RON,He looks a bit peakydoesn't he?
FRED,Peaky?
FRED,What do you expect?
FRED,He fell over 100 feet.
GEORGE,Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
HARRY,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
HERMIONE,How are you feeling?
HARRY,Ohbrilliant.
GEORGE,You gave us a right good scare.
HARRY,What happened?
RON,Wellyou fell off your broom.
HARRY,Really? I meant the match. Who won?
HERMIONE,No one blames youHarry.
HERMIONE,Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
HERMIONE,After he saved youhe sent them off.
RON,There's something else you should know too.
RON,When you fellyour broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willowand...Well...
LUPIN,I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
LUPIN,Is there no chance of fixing it?
HARRY,No.
HARRY,Professorwhy do the dementors affect me so?
HARRY,I meanmore than everyone else?
LUPIN,Listen.
LUPIN,Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
LUPIN,They feed on every good feelingevery happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
LUPIN,You are not weakHarry.
LUPIN,Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
LUPIN,Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
LUPIN,You have nothing to be ashamed of.
HARRY,I'm scaredprofessor.
LUPIN,WellI'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
HARRY,I need to know how to fight them.
HARRY,You could teach me.
HARRY,You made the one on the train go away.
LUPIN,There was only one that night.
HARRY,But you made it go away.
LUPIN,I don't pretend to be an expertHarry.
LUPIN,But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
LUPIN,But after the holidays.
LUPIN,For nowI need to rest.
RON,Last call for Hogsmeade!
LUPIN,Come onnow!
HARRY,Guyslet me go.
FRED,CleverHarry.
GEORGE,But not clever enough.
FRED,We've got a better way.
HARRY,I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
FRED,We know.
FRED,We'll get you there.
GEORGE,We'll show you a quicker way.
FRED,If you pipe down.
FRED,Bless him.
HARRY,Let me go! Come onguys. Don't...
FRED,NowHarry.
GEORGE,Come and join the big boys.
HARRY,What are you doing?!
HARRY,What's this rubbish?
GEORGE,What's this rubbish? he says.
FRED,It's the secret to our success.
GEORGE,It's a wrench giving it to you...
FRED,But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
FRED,Georgeif you will.
GEORGE,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
HARRY,Messrs. MoonyWormtailPadfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map.
GEORGE,We owe them so much.
HARRY,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And thatâ€¦
HARRY,No. Is that really...?
FRED,Dumbledore.
GEORGE,In his study.
FRED,Pacing.
GEORGE,Does that a lot.
HARRY,So you mean this map shows...
FRED,Everyone.
HARRY,Everyone?
GEORGE,Where they are.
FRED,What they're doing.
GEORGE,Every minute.
FRED,Every day.
HARRY,Brilliant! Where did you get it?
FRED,From Filch's office.
FRED,First year.
GEORGE,There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
GEORGE,We'd recommend this one.
FRED,The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
GEORGE,Leads straight you to Honeyduke's.
FRED,Hurry. Filch is heading this way.
GEORGE,Oh Harry and don't forget. When you're donejust give it a tap and say:
GEORGE,Mischief managed.
GEORGE,Otherwiseanyone can read it.
WITCH,Nowhow much do you want?
RON,Delicious.
HERMIONE,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
RON,Twice.
HERMIONE,Do you want to move a bit closer?
HERMIONE,To the Shrieking Shack?
RON,ActuallyI'm fine here.
DRACO,Wellwell. Look who's here.
DRACO,You two shopping for your new dream home?
DRACO,Bit grand for youisn't itWeasle-Bee?
DRACO,Don't your family sleep in one room?
RON,Shut your mouthMalfoy.
DRACO,Not very friendly.
DRACO,BoysI think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
HERMIONE,Hope you don't mean yourself.
DRACO,How dare you talk to me!
DRACO,You filthy little mudblood!
DRACO,Who is that?
DRACO,Don't stand there! Do something!
CRABBE,What?
RON,What's upMalfoy? Lost your skis?
DRACO,Get out of the way!
DRACO,Move!
CRABBE,Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
HERMIONE,Harry!
RON,Bloody hellHarry.
RON,That was not funny.
RON,Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
HERMIONE,He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
RON,Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
HERMIONE,Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
HERMIONE,Ron fancies her.
RON,That's not true!
FUDGE,Professor McGonagall!
MCGONAGALL,Cornelius!
HAGRID,Allow meminister.
FUDGE,OhHagrid...
HAGRID,Sorry about that.
FUDGE,Rosmertamy dear.
FUDGE,I hope business is good.
MADAM ROSMERTA,It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
FUDGE,We have...We have a killer on the loose.
MADAM ROSMERTA,Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
MADAM ROSMERTA,And what would bring him here?
FUDGE,Harry Potter.
MADAM ROSMERTA,Harry Potter?
FUDGE,Shh! Come.
HERMIONE,Harry!
SHRUNKEN HEAD,No underage wizards allowed in today!
SHRUNKEN HEAD,Shut the damn door!
HERMIONE,So rude.
RON,Thick heads.
SHRUNKEN HEAD,Thick heads?!
SHRUNKEN HEAD,How dare they!
SHRUNKEN HEAD,Who are they calling thick heads?
SHRUNKEN HEAD,Young whippersnappers!
MADAM ROSMERTA,Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
MCGONAGALL,Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
MADAM ROSMERTA,Tell me what this is all about.
MCGONAGALL,Years agowhen Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
MCGONAGALL,Remember? They hid.
MCGONAGALL,Few knew where they were.
MCGONAGALL,One who did was Sirius Black.
MCGONAGALL,And he told You-Know-Who.
FUDGE,Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed one of their friends Peter Pettigrew!
MADAM ROSMERTA,Peter Pettigrew?
MCGONAGALL,Little lump of a boy.
MCGONAGALL,Always trailing after Black.
MADAM ROSMERTA,I remember.
MADAM ROSMERTA,Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
MADAM ROSMERTA,What happened?
MCGONAGALL,Peter tried to warn the Potters and might havehad he not run into an old friendSirius Black.
FUDGE,Black was vicious.
FUDGE,He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him!
FUDGE,A finger. That's all that was left.
FUDGE,A finger. Nothing else.
MCGONAGALL,YesSirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead.
FUDGE,And now he wants to finish what he started.
MADAM ROSMERTA,I don't believe it.
FUDGE,That's not the worst of it.
MADAM ROSMERTA,What could be worse?
MCGONAGALL,This: Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
HERMIONE,Ronlook!
HERMIONE,Sorry. Sorry. Excuse meexcuse me.
RON,Merry Christmas.
HERMIONE,Harrywhat happened?
HARRY,He was their friend and he betrayed them.
HARRY,He was their friend!
HARRY,I hope he finds me.
HARRY,Because when he doesI'm gonna be ready!
HARRY,When he doesI'm gonna kill him!
LUPIN,Harry. There you are. You came.
LUPIN,Are you sure about thisHarry?
LUPIN,This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
HARRY,I'm sure.
LUPIN,Welleverything's prepared.
LUPIN,The spell I'm going to try yo teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
LUPIN,Did you ever hear of it?
LUPIN,No? Well...A Patronus is a positive force.
LUPIN,For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shieldwith the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
LUPIN,But in order for it to workyou need to think of a memory.
LUPIN,Not just any memorya very happy memorya very powerful memory.
LUPIN,Can you do this?
HARRY,Yes.
LUPIN,Very well. Close your eyes.
LUPIN,Concentrate.
LUPIN,Explore your past.
LUPIN,Do you have a memory?
LUPIN,Allow it to fill you up.
LUPIN,Lose yourself within it.
LUPIN,Then speak the incantationExpecto Patronum.
HARRY,Expecto Patronum.
LUPIN,Very good.
HARRY,Shall we? Wand at the ready.
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
HARRY,Expecto... Expecto...Expect...
LUPIN,Here we go. Come on.
LUPIN,Sit up. Deep breaths.
LUPIN,It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
LUPIN,That would have been remarkable.
LUPIN,Hereeat this. You'll feel better.
HARRY,That's one nasty dementor.
LUPIN,Ohnonono.
LUPIN,That was a boggartHarry. A boggart.
LUPIN,The real thing would be worse.
LUPIN,Muchmuch worse.
LUPIN,As a matter of interestwhat were you thinking?
LUPIN,Which memory did you choose?
HARRY,The first time I rode a broom.
LUPIN,That's not good enough.
LUPIN,Not nearly good enough.
HARRY,There's another.
HARRY,It's not happyexactly.
HARRY,Wellit is.
HARRY,It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
LUPIN,Is it strong?
LUPIN,Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
HARRY,Just do it.
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
LUPIN,Yes! Well doneHarry. Well done!
HARRY,I think I've had enough for today.
LUPIN,Yes. Sit down. Here.
LUPIN,Eat thisit helps. It really helps.
LUPIN,And just so you knowHarry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
LUPIN,And that is saying something.
HARRY,I was thinking of him. And Mum.
HARRY,Seeing their faces.
HARRY,They were talking to me.
HARRY,Just talking.
HARRY,That's the memory I chose.
HARRY,I don't even know if it's real.
HARRY,But it's the best I have.
HERMIONE,Beautiful day.
RON,Gorgeous.
RON,Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
HARRY,Ripped to pieces?
HARRY,What are you talking about?
HERMIONE,Ronald has lost his rat.
RON,I haven't lost anything!
RON,Your cat killed him!
HERMIONE,Rubbish.
RON,Harryyou've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about.
RON,And Scabbers is gone.
HERMIONE,Wellmaybe you should learn to take better care of your pets!
RON,Your cat killed him!
HERMIONE,Did not.
RON,Did.
HERMIONE,Didn't.
HERMIONE,How did it goHagrid? The hearing?
HAGRID,Wellfirst offthe committee members took turns talking about why we were there.
HAGRID,I got up and did my piece.
HAGRID,Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriffalways cleaned his feathers.
HAGRID,And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
HAGRID,Wellyou can imagine.
HAGRID,He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
HERMIONE,And then?
HAGRID,And then he asked for the worstdid old Lucius.
RON,They're not sacking you!
HAGRID,NoI'm not sacked.
HAGRID,Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
RON,Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
RON,Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
RON,I don't wanna tap-dance!
HARRY,Tell those spiders.
RON,Rightyeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...
MADAM ROSMERTA,Peter Pettigrew?
MCGONAGALL,Little lump of a boy.
MCGONAGALL,Always trailing after Sirius Black.
FUDGE,Black was vicious.
FUDGE,He didn 't kill Pettigrewhe destroyed him!
VOICE,Put that light out!
HARRY,Sorry.
VOICE,Watch it thereboy.
VOICE,We're trying to sleep here!
HARRY,Mischief managed. Nox.
SNAPE,Potter.
SNAPE,What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
HARRY,I was sleepwalking.
SNAPE,How extraordinarily like your father you arePotter.
SNAPE,Hetoowas exceedingly arrogantstrutting about the castle.
HARRY,My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
HARRY,If you don't mindI would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
SNAPE,Turn out your pockets.
SNAPE,Turn out your pockets!
SNAPE,What's this?
HARRY,Spare bit of parchment.
SNAPE,Really? Open it.
SNAPE,Reveal your secrets.
SNAPE,Read it.
HARRY,Messrs. MoonyWormtailPadfootand Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...
SNAPE,Go on.
HARRY,And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business.
SNAPE,You insolent little...
LUPIN,Professor!
SNAPE,Wellwell. Lupin.
SNAPE,Out for a little walk in the moonlightare we?
LUPIN,Harryare you all right?
SNAPE,That remains to be seen.
SNAPE,I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
SNAPE,Take a lookLupin.
SNAPE,Supposed to be your area of expertise.
SNAPE,Clearlyit's full of dark magic.
LUPIN,I seriously doubt itSeverus.
LUPIN,It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
LUPIN,I suspect it's a Zonko product.
LUPIN,NeverthelessI shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
LUPIN,It isafter allas you saymy area of expertise.
LUPIN,Harrywould you come with meplease? Professorgood night.
VOICE,Are you deaf? Put that light out!
LUPIN,Come in.
LUPIN,I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite franklyI am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
LUPIN,Did it never occur to you that thisin the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?
LUPIN,No.
HARRY,Nosir.
LUPIN,Your father never set much store by the rules either.
LUPIN,But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
LUPIN,Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
LUPIN,NowI will not cover up for you again.
LUPIN,Do you hear me?
HARRY,Yessir.
LUPIN,I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
LUPIN,And don't take any detours.
LUPIN,If you doI shall know.
HARRY,Professorjust so you knowI don't think that map always works.
HARRY,Earlierit showed someone in the castle.
HARRY,Someone I know to be dead.
LUPIN,Ohreally? And who might that be?
HARRY,Peter Pettigrew.
LUPIN,That's not possible.
HARRY,It's just what I saw.
HARRY,Good nightprofessor.
TRELAWNEY,Broaden your minds.
TRELAWNEY,You must look beyond.
TRELAWNEY,The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
TRELAWNEY,Only then can you see. Try again.
TRELAWNEY,Nowwhat do we have here?
HERMIONE,Do you mind me trying?
HERMIONE,The Grimpossibly.
TRELAWNEY,My dearfrom the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.
TRELAWNEY,Noyou seethere.
TRELAWNEY,You may be young in yearsbut your heart is as shriveled as an old maid'syour soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
TRELAWNEY,Have I said something?
RON,She's gone mentalHermione has.
RON,I meannot that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
HARRY,Hang on.
HARRY,We better take this back.
RON,I'm not going back.
HARRY,Fine. See you later.
RON,See you.
VOICE,Harry Potter
HARRY,Professor Trelawney...
TRELAWNEY,He will return tonight.
HARRY,Sorry?
TRELAWNEY,Tonighthe who betrayed his friendswhose heart rots with murder shall break free.
TRELAWNEY,Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
TRELAWNEY,I'm so sorrydear boy.
TRELAWNEY,Did you say something?
HARRY,No. Nothing.
HERMIONE,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
RON,It just got worse.
DRACO,What did I say? Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
DRACO,I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
DRACO,This is going to be rich.
GOYLE,Look who's here.
DRACO,Come to see the show?
HERMIONE,You! You foulloathsomeevil little cockroach!
RON,Hermioneno!
RON,He's not worth it.
GOYLE,Malfoyare you okay?
GOYLE,Let's go. Quick.
DRACO,Not a word to anyoneunderstood?
HERMIONE,That felt good.
RON,Not goodbrilliant.
HAGRID,Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
HARRY,Why don't we just set him free?
HAGRID,They'd know it was meand then Dumbledore would get into trouble.
HAGRID,He's coming downDumbledore.
HAGRID,Says he wants to be with me when they...When it happens.
HAGRID,Great manDumbledore.
HAGRID,A great man.
HERMIONE,We'll stay with you too.
HAGRID,You'll do no such thing!
HAGRID,Think I want you seeing something like that? No.
HAGRID,You just drink your tea and be off.
HAGRID,Oh. Before you doRon...
RON,Scabbers! You're alive!
HAGRID,Keep a closer eye on your pet.
HERMIONE,I think you owe someone an apology.
RON,Right. Next time I see CrookshanksI'll let him know.
HERMIONE,I meant me!
HAGRID,Blimey. What was that?
HARRY,Hagrid!
HAGRID,Ohcrikey.
DUMBLEDORE,Nominister. Over this way.
HAGRID,It's late. It's nearly dark.

HERMIONE,We're in the Shrieking Shackaren't we?
HARRY,Come on.
HARRY,Ron.
HERMIONE,Ron. You're okay.
HARRY,The dog. Where is it?
RON,It's a trap. He's the dog.
RON,He's an Animagus.
HERMIONE,If you want to kill Harryyou have to kill us too!
SIRIUS,No. Only one will die tonight.
HARRY,Then it'll be you!
SIRIUS,Are you going to kill meHarry?
LUPIN,Expelliarmus!

SIRIUS,It's him.
LUPIN,I understand.
SIRIUS,Let's kill him!
HERMIONE,No! I trusted you!
HERMIONE,And all this timeyou've been his friend.
HERMIONE,He's a werewolf!
HERMIONE,That's why he's been missing classes.
LUPIN,How long have you known?
HERMIONE,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
LUPIN,WellHermione.
LUPIN,You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
SIRIUS,Enough talkRemus!

LUPIN,Harry has the right to know why.
HARRY,I know why.
HARRY,You betrayed my parents.

LUPIN,Severus...
SNAPE,I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
SIRIUS,BrilliantSnape.
SIRIUS,Once again you've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
SIRIUS,If you'll excuse usRemus and I have business to attend to.
SNAPE,Give me a reason. I beg you!
LUPIN,Severus don't be a fool.
SIRIUS,He can't help it. It's habit.
LUPIN,Sirius be quiet.
SIRIUS,Be quiet yourself!
SNAPE,You twoquarrelling like an old married couple.
SIRIUS,Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!
SNAPE,I could do ityou know.
SNAPE,But why deny the dementors?
SNAPE,They're so longing to see you.
SNAPE,Do I detect a flicker of fear?
SNAPE,Ohyes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like.
SNAPE,It's said to be nearly unbearable to witnessbut I'll do my best.
LUPIN,Severusplease.
SNAPE,After you.
HARRY,Expelliarmus!
RON,Harry! What did you just do?
HERMIONE,You attacked a teacher!
HARRY,Tell me about Peter.
LUPIN,He was at school with us.
LUPIN,We thought he was our friend!
HARRY,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
LUPIN,Nohe didn't.
LUPIN,I thought so toountil you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
HARRY,The map was lyingthen.
SIRIUS,The map never lies!
SIRIUS,Pettigrew's alive!
SIRIUS,And he's right there!
RON,Me?! He's mental!
SIRIUS,Not you! Your rat!
RON,Scabbers has been in my family for...
SIRIUS,Twelve years?
SIRIUS,Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
SIRIUS,He's missing a toeisn't he?
RON,So what?
HARRY,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
SIRIUS,Finger!
SIRIUS,Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
SIRIUS,And then he transformed into a rat!
HARRY,Show me.
HARRY,Give it to himRon.
RON,What are you trying to do to him?
RON,Scabbers!
RON,Leave him alone! Get off him!
RON,What are you doing?
PETTIGREW,Remus? Sirius. My old friends!
PETTIGREW,Harry! Look at you.
PETTIGREW,You look so much like your father.
PETTIGREW,James. We were the best of friends...
SIRIUS,How dare you speak to Harry!
SIRIUS,How dare you talk about James in front of him!
LUPIN,You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
PETTIGREW,I didn't mean to!
PETTIGREW,The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
PETTIGREW,Ask yourselfSirius!
PETTIGREW,What would you have done?
PETTIGREW,What would you have done?
SIRIUS,I'm gonna diedI'm gonna die rather than betray my friends!
PETTIGREW,James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
PETTIGREW,Your dad would have spared me!
PETTIGREW,He would have shown me mercy!
SIRIUS,Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill youwe would. Together!
HARRY,No!
LUPIN,Harrythis man...
HARRY,I know what he is.
HARRY,But we'll take him to the castle.
PETTIGREW,Bless youboy. Bless you!
HARRY,Get off!
HARRY,I said we'd take you to the castle.
HARRY,After thatthe dementors can have you.
SIRIUS,Sorry about the bite.
SIRIUS,I reckon that twinges a bit.
RON,A bit? A bit?
RON,You almost tore my leg off!
SIRIUS,I was going for the rat.
SIRIUS,NormallyI have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
SIRIUS,More than onceJames suggested that I make the change permanent.
SIRIUS,The tail I could live with.
SIRIUS,But the fleasthey're murder.
HARRY,Okay.
RON,You better go.
HARRY,No. Don't worryokay?
HARRY,It's fine. I'll stay.
HERMIONE,You goI'll stay.
HARRY,You okay?
RON,I'm fine. Go.
HERMIONE,That looks really painful.
RON,So painful.
RON,They might chop it.
HERMIONE,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
RON,It's too late. It's ruined.
RON,It'll have to be chopped off.
SIRIUS,It's beautifulisn't it?
SIRIUS,I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
SIRIUS,It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
SIRIUS,That was a noble thing you did back there.
SIRIUS,He doesn't deserve it.
HARRY,I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
HARRY,Besidesdeadthe truth dies with him.
HARRY,Aliveyou're free.
PETTIGREW,Turn me into a flobberworm.
PETTIGREW,Anything but the dementors!
PETTIGREW,Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
PETTIGREW,You won't let them give me to the dementorswill you?
PETTIGREW,I was your rat!
PETTIGREW,Sweetclever girl! Surely you won't...
LUPIN,Get away from her!
SIRIUS,I don't know if you knowHarry but when you were bornJames and Lily made me your godfather.
HARRY,I know.
SIRIUS,I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
HARRY,What? Come and live with you?
SIRIUS,It's just a thought.
SIRIUS,I can understand if you don't want to.
HERMIONE,Harry!
SIRIUS,Remusmy old friend.
SIRIUS,Have you taken your potion tonight?
SIRIUS,You know the man you truly areRemus!

HERMIONE,Listen Harrythey've captured Sirius.
HERMIONE,Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
HARRY,They're gonna kill him?
HERMIONE,No. It's worse.
HERMIONE,Much worse.
HERMIONE,They're going to suck out his soul.
HERMIONE,Headmasteryou've got to stop them.
HERMIONE,They've got the wrong man.
HARRY,It's true sir. Sirius is innocent.
RON,It's Scabbers who did it.
DUMBLEDORE,Scabbers?
RON,He's my ratsir.
RON,He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
RON,He was my brother Percy's rat.
RON,But then they gave him an owl...
HERMIONE,The point iswe know the truth.
HERMIONE,Please believe us.
DUMBLEDORE,I doMiss Granger.
DUMBLEDORE,But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
DUMBLEDORE,A child's voicehowever honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
DUMBLEDORE,Mysterious thingtime.
DUMBLEDORE,Powerful and when meddled withdangerous.
DUMBLEDORE,Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
DUMBLEDORE,You know the lawsMiss Granger
DUMBLEDORE,You must not be seen.
DUMBLEDORE,And you would do wellI feelto return before this last chime.
DUMBLEDORE,If notthe consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
DUMBLEDORE,If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
DUMBLEDORE,Three turns should do itI think.
DUMBLEDORE,Ohand by the way.
DUMBLEDORE,When in doubtI find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
DUMBLEDORE,Good luck.
RON,What the bloody hell was that all about?
HERMIONE,SorryRonbut seeing as you can't walk...
HARRY,What just happened?
HARRY,Where's Ron?
HERMIONE,07:30. Where were we at 7:30?

RON,Hermioneno! He's not worth it.
HARRY,This is not normal.
HERMIONE,This is a Time-TurnerHarry.
HERMIONE,McGonagall gave it to me first term.
HERMIONE,This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
HARRY,You mean we've gone back in time?
HERMIONE,Yes.
HERMIONE,Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
HERMIONE,Clearlysomething happened he wants us to change.
HARRY,Good punch.

HERMIONE,If we succeedmore than one innocent life could be spared.
HERMIONE,Let's go.
HARRY,Here they come. I'd better hurry.

HERMIONE,Otherwisehe'll think Hagrid set him free.
RON,Scabbersyou're alive!
HAGRID,Keep a closer eye on your pet.
HARRY,That's Pettigrew.

HERMIONE,Why aren't we leaving?

FUDGE,Come nowDumbledore.
FUDGE,Someone's obviously released him.
FUDGE,Hagrid?
HERMIONE,Buckbeak.
DUMBLEDORE,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
DUMBLEDORE,AfterallHow could you?

LUPIN,Immobulus!
HERMIONE,And Snape's coming.
HARRY,And now we wait.
HERMIONE,And now we wait.
HERMIONE,At least someone's enjoying himself.
HARRY,Yeah.
HARRY,Hermione?
HERMIONE,Yeah?
HARRY,Beforedown by the lakewhen I was with Sirius I did see someone.
HARRY,That someone made the dementors go away.
HERMIONE,With a Patronus.
HERMIONE,I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
HERMIONE,According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
HARRY,It was my dad.
HARRY,It was my dad conjured the Patronus.
HERMIONE,Harrybut your dad's...
HARRY,Dead. I know.
HARRY,I'm just telling you what I saw.
HERMIONE,Here we come.
HARRY,You see Sirius talking to me there?
HARRY,He's asking me to come live with him.
HERMIONE,That's great.
HARRY,When we free himI'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
HARRY,It'll just be me and him.
HARRY,We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
HARRY,He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
HERMIONE,Harry!
SIRIUS,Run! Run!
HARRY,Let's go.
HARRY,What are you doing?
HERMIONE,Saving your life.
HARRY,Thanks.
HARRY,Great. Now he's coming for us.
HERMIONE,YeahI didn't think about that. Run!
HERMIONE,That was so scary.
HARRY,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
HARRY,Sirius. Come on!
HERMIONE,This is horrible.
HARRY,Don't worry.
HARRY,My dad will come.
HARRY,He'll conjure the Patronus.
HARRY,Any minute now.
HARRY,Right there. You'll see.
HERMIONE,Harrylisten to me.
HERMIONE,No one's coming.
HARRY,Don't worryhe will.
HARRY,He will come.
HARRY,Sirius.
HERMIONE,You're dying both of you.
HERMIONE,Harry!
HARRY,Expecto Patronum!
HARRY,You were rightHermione.
HARRY,It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!
HARRY,I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
HARRY,I knew I could do it this time because wellI had already done it.
HARRY,Does that make sense?
HERMIONE,No. But I don't like flying...!
HERMIONE,Bombarda!
SIRIUS,I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
HARRY,I want to go with you.
SIRIUS,One dayperhaps.
SIRIUS,For some timemy life will be too unpredictable.
SIRIUS,And besides you're meant to be here.
HARRY,But you're innocent.
SIRIUS,And you know it.
SIRIUS,And for nowthat will do.
SIRIUS,I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
SIRIUS,Except your eyes. You have...
HARRY,My mother's eyes.
SIRIUS,It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lilyand you so little.
SIRIUS,But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us.
SIRIUS,And you can always find them in here.
SIRIUS,You really are the brightest witch of your age.
HERMIONE,We have to go.
DUMBLEDORE,Well?
HARRY,He's free. We did it.

LUPIN,This time tomorrowthe owls will start arriving and parents will not want wellsomeone like me teaching their children.
HARRY,But Dumbledore...
LUPIN,Dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf.
LUPIN,Besidespeople like me are...
LUPIN,Welllet's just say that I'm used to it by now.
LUPIN,Why do you look so miserableHarry?
HARRY,None of it made any difference.
HARRY,Pettigrew escaped.
LUPIN,Didn't make any difference?
LUPIN,HarryIt made all the difference in the world.
LUPIN,You uncovered the truth.
LUPIN,You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
LUPIN,It made a great deal of difference.
LUPIN,If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
LUPIN,Nowsince I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
LUPIN,So now I'll say goodbyeHarry.
